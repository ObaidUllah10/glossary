## Velocity

Velocity is the master KPI you should look at.
It is a measure of the amount of work your team can tackle during a single sprint and is the key metric in Scrum.
How fast are we going is the question. It is a compound indicator of 5 different variables that are
(n) number of commits,
(e) edition,
(t) number of merged tickets,
(p) merged tickets average lead time,
(r) average time to review.
The computation is: velocity = n * e * t / (1000 * p * r).

Augmenting the teams' velocity should be your goal as a manager.
To do so, you have to identify the pain points in your organization such as stale tickets and lack of reviews.

In the future we will offer tooling and learning to augment your velocity.

## Feature

## LOCs

Using Lines Of Code (LOCs) as a metric is meaningful on large scales only. So using it project-wise makes sense. Comparing LOCs produced per developer is pointless since their work may differ qualitatively. But comparing the evolution of LOCs sprints-wise gives a macrocopic view of your progress.

Remember to exclude large autogenerated files from the analysis by setting the exclusion patterns in our app.
